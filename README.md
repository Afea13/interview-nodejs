# Technical interview - Node.js/Typescript
A repository to help with technical interviews using a Node.js/Express backend with vanilla JS frontend

## Prerequisistes
This repository comes with a devcontainer that is set up with all basic tooling to develop a
Node.js/Express.js API in Typescript and run tests via Jest.

To get set up:
1. Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
 and [VSCode Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) if necessary

Alternatively you can of course use your own IDE setup.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository
2. If you use the Dev Container, open the root folder in VSCode and then select `Dev Containers: Reopen folder in container` from the Command Palette
2. Run `npm install` from the project root
3. Run `npm start` to run the API with hot reload
4. Run `npm test` to run the tests via Jest. In the Dev Container you can also use the Test Explorer tree view in the sidebar.
